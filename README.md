# Automata
This repository contains the two projects developed in the formal languages and automata theory class. Both projects
are developed in Haskell.
The first one (DFA2Regex) is basically an algorithm to convert a deterministic finite state Automata to its
corresponding regular expression. 
The second one uses regular expressions to build an organized data base (.CSV file) from a very messy .txt file
downloaded from Wikipedia with information about famous mathematicians .
