This program basically receives a DFA and returns its equivalent regular expression,
in order to represent the same type of language.

To use our program you must call the function 'dfa2Regex' that has as parameter that is
a DFA, which has to be defined using the module of DFA. If you want to see it you must 
print it in the main.
