ExtractData

Simón Fallon Giraldo

This program basically receives a .xml file which contains a list of Wikipedia 
articles. It goes through it looking for the information of the infoboxes of 
each article to collect it and then store it, creating a new file named 
"infoboxData.csv". 

To use the program you must specify the .xml file that should be read in the
main function. By default its reading "data.xml" but you should change it if
needed. Then you just have to compile the code to create the .CSV file 
"infoboxData.csv" with the information.
