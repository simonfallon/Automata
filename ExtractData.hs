Module : ExtractData
Description : Contains all relevant methods. Reads the .xml file and extracts
the information to a .CSV file
Copyright : SimÃ³n Fallon
This module contains the main function extData and the other methods that were
implemented in order to extract the infoboxes information from the xml file.
This module reads the .xml file to a string and then calls extData to extract
the information from the infoboxes of the Wikipedia articles. It then stores it
in a new file named "infoboxData.csv".

 a different character type. It is used tu avoid characters like "[,]"

 returns it
